# cpp-project-template

A minimal C++ project template with CMake, Docker-based development environment, and VS Code Dev Containers support.

**Stack:** C++20, CMake 3.16+, Ubuntu 24.04 (GCC, CMake, Git)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) — for the development environment
- CMake 3.16+ — only needed if building outside Docker

## Development environment

Docker provides a consistent build environment. Scripts live in `docker/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `docker_run.sh` | Start an interactive shell (builds the image on first run) |
| `docker_build.sh` | Rebuild the `cpp-env` image |
| `docker_clean.sh` | Stop containers and remove the `cpp-env` image |

Start the environment from the project root:

```bash
./docker/docker_run.sh
```

Your project directory is mounted at `/project` inside the container.

Clean up when done:

```bash
./docker/docker_clean.sh
```

## VS Code Dev Containers

The [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension opens the project in the same Docker image. It installs C++ and CMake extensions automatically.

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. **Ctrl+Shift+P** → **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

The container uses `docker/Dockerfile` (same as `docker_run.sh`).

## Build

CMake is the build system. From inside the container (or locally with CMake installed):

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Run the executable:

```bash
./cpp-project-template
```

Clean the build directory:

```bash
rm -rf build
```
